# Microbot AtlasLoot - WoW Vanilla (1.12.1) AddOn

A customized version of the classic World of Warcraft AtlasLoot addon with custom loot for the Microbot private server added. In this version, tables have been added for custom Microbot consumables, eternal items, legendaries, utility items, and more.

This addon was built by members of the Microbot community (original credit to Jacob), and I have updated the tables to work with the latest DB changes as of 9/3/24, re-arranged the table structure, and added new custom items since the last update.
